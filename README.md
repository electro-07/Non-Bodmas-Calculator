### simple calculator that does not use BODMAS (Made entirely in C#)

#### Features:
- basic arithmetic
- Random Numbers
- PI and E
- Sin, Cos and Tan
- squares and square roots

Instructions:

\+ = Addition (10 + 20 gives 30)  
\- = Subtraction (10 - 20 gives -10)  
\* = Multiplication(10 * 20 gives 200)  
/ = Division (10 / 20 gives 0.5)  
^ = Power (10 ^ 2 gives 100)  
% = Percent (500% gives 5)  
!- = Random Number (!10-20 gives a random number between 10 and 20)  
, = Round (10 / 3 ,2 gives 3.33)  
: = Square Root (16: gives 4)  
S = Sin (90 S gives 1)  
C = Cos (90 C gives 0)  
T = Tan (45 T gives 1)  
e = Euler's Number (e gives 2.71828...)  
p = PI (e gives 3.14159...)  
_ = Old Answer (3 + 3 gives 6, so _ will then give 6)  

Type X to toggle commas  
Brackets and spaces can be added anywhere but they do not need to be added
